Welcome to my portfolio for CS-300 at SNHU. This repository contains selected projects showcasing my skills and learning in data structures and algorithms. Below, you will find reflections on my work, including the analysis of run-time and memory for data structures and a project that sorts and prints a list of courses in the Computer Science program.

## Project One: Analysis of Run-Time and Memory for Data Structures

### Problem Statement
In Project One, the goal was to analyze the run-time and memory usage of various data structures including vectors, hash tables, and trees when loading bid data from a CSV file.

### Approach
To tackle this problem, I implemented functions to load bids into each data structure, measuring their performance in terms of run-time and memory usage. Understanding data structures is crucial because they directly affect the efficiency of the algorithms we write.

### Overcoming Roadblocks
One challenge I faced was ensuring accurate measurement of run-time and memory usage. I overcame this by using precise timing functions and memory profiling tools, iterating on my approach until I achieved consistent results.

### Expanded Approach to Software Design
Working on this project has taught me the importance of selecting the appropriate data structure based on the problem requirements. It has expanded my approach to designing software by emphasizing the need for efficiency and scalability.

### Evolution in Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code
This project has also improved my coding practices. I learned to write code that is not only efficient but also maintainable and readable. Clear documentation and structured code have become a priority in my development process.
